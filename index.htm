			<h2>How It All Started</h2>
			<p>Fido's owner, John, first noticed his dog's unusual talent when Fido was just a puppy. He would play fetch with Fido in the backyard, and one day Fido started juggling the ball with his paws instead of just catching it. John was amazed and decided to train Fido to perfect his juggling skills.</p>
