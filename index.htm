			<p class="text-lg mb-8">Fido's owner, John, first noticed his dog's unusual talent when Fido was just a
				puppy. He would play fetch with Fido in the backyard, and one day Fido started juggling the ball with
				his paws instead of just catching it. John was amazed and decided to train Fido to perfect his juggling
				skills.</p>

			<p class="text-lg mb-8">Training Fido to juggle a ball wasn't easy, but John was determined to help his
				furry friend reach his full potential. He started by teaching Fido how to hold the ball with his paws,
				and then gradually introduced the concept of juggling. Fido caught on quickly and soon became a master
				juggler.</p>

			<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Science Behind Fido's Juggling</h2>
			<p class="text-lg mb-8">Juggling is actually a great way to improve a dog's cognitive abilities. It requires
				them to focus, use their paws in a coordinated way, and think about the object they are juggling.
				Studies have shown that dogs who are trained to juggle have better problem-solving skills and are more
				mentally stimulated.</p>
