	<h1>Capybaras - The Fascinating Giant Rodents of South America</h1>
	<p>Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world and are found in South America. They live in groups and thrive in a variety of habitats. Capybaras are fascinating creatures with unique physical characteristics and social behaviors.</p>

	<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
	<p>Capybaras are typically 1 to 1.3 meters long and can weigh up to 66 kilograms. They have short, dark fur that keeps them warm in the water, webbed feet that help them swim, and eyes and nostrils that sit on top of their heads, allowing them to see and breathe while partially submerged. Capybaras have a unique digestive system that allows them to extract more nutrients from the food they eat, which is mostly grass, fruit, and bark.</p>

	<h2>Social Behavior</h2>
	<p>Capybaras are social animals and typically live in groups of 10 to 20 individuals. They have a hierarchical structure, with dominant males leading the group and mating with multiple females. Capybaras are very vocal and communicate with each other through a variety of sounds, such as barks, whistles, and grunts.</p>

	<h2>Relationship with Humans</h2>
	<p>Capybaras are considered a delicacy in some parts of South America and are hunted for their meat and hides. However, they are also popular as pets in some countries, particularly in Japan. Capybaras have a friendly and docile nature, and are often seen interacting with humans in the wild.</p>
