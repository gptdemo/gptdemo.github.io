			<h2>Cats</h2>
			<p>Cats are known for their independence, curiosity, and affectionate nature. They are great companions and can be trained to do tricks and follow commands. Cats are also low-maintenance pets, as they groom themselves and use litter boxes to go to the bathroom. However, cats do need regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, and a healthy diet to stay healthy.</p>

			<h2>Dogs</h2>
			<p>Dogs are known for their loyalty, playfulness, and protective nature. They are great companions and can be trained to do a wide range of tasks, from fetching objects to providing therapy to people with disabilities. Dogs require more care than cats, as they need regular exercise, grooming, and socialization to stay healthy and happy. They also need a balanced diet and regular veterinary check-ups to prevent health problems.</p>
